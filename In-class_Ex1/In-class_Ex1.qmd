## Overview

This is in-class exercise 1.

## Getting Started

The code chunk below will install and load [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and [sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) packages.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, tidyverse)
```

`pacman::p_load(xxx)` is similar to `import xxx` in python. Normally we don't need the `pacman::`, but here because we don't load the package, so we need to cite is before the `p_load`.

## Importing Geospatial Data

### Importing polygon features

This code chunk will import ESRI shapefile into R.

```{r}
hunan <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", layer = "Hunan")
```

### Importing and transforming into projected coordinates system

```{r}
hunan_2012 = read_csv("data/aspatial/Hunan_2012.csv")
```
