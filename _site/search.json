This is a wrong EPSG code because the correct EPSG code for svy21 should be 3414.\nIn order to assign the correct EPSG code to mpsz data frame, st_set_crs() of sf package is used as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nmpsz3414 <- st_set_crs(mpsz, 3414)\n\nWarning: st_crs<- : replacing crs does not reproject data; use st_transform for\nthat\n\n\nNow, let us check the CSR again by using the code chunk below.\n\nst_crs(mpsz3414)\n\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: EPSG:3414 \n  wkt:\nPROJCRS[\"SVY21 / Singapore TM\",\n    BASEGEOGCRS[\"SVY21\",\n        DATUM[\"SVY21\",\n            ELLIPSOID[\"WGS 84\",6378137,298.257223563,\n                LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]]],\n        PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n        ID[\"EPSG\",4757]],\n    CONVERSION[\"Singapore Transverse Mercator\",\n        METHOD[\"Transverse Mercator\",\n            ID[\"EPSG\",9807]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Latitude of natural origin\",1.36666666666667,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8801]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Longitude of natural origin\",103.833333333333,\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8802]],\n        PARAMETER[\"Scale factor at natural origin\",1,\n            SCALEUNIT[\"unity\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8805]],\n        PARAMETER[\"False easting\",28001.642,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8806]],\n        PARAMETER[\"False northing\",38744.572,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1],\n            ID[\"EPSG\",8807]]],\n    CS[Cartesian,2],\n        AXIS[\"northing (N)\",north,\n            ORDER[1],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],\n        AXIS[\"easting (E)\",east,\n            ORDER[2],\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]],\n    USAGE[\n        SCOPE[\"Cadastre, engineering survey, topographic mapping.\"],\n        AREA[\"Singapore - onshore and offshore.\"],\n        BBOX[1.13,103.59,1.47,104.07]],\n    ID[\"EPSG\",3414]]\n\n\nNotice that the EPSG code is 3414 now.\n\n\nTransforming the projection of preschool from wgs84 to svy21.\nIn geospatial analytics, it is very common for us to transform the original data from geographic coordinate system to projected coordinate system. This is because geographic coordinate system is not appropriate if the analysis need to use distance or/and area measurements.\nLet us take preschool simple feature data frame as an example. The print below reveals that it is in wgs84 coordinate system.\n\nst_geometry(preschool)\n\nGeometry set for 1359 features \nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XYZ\nBounding box:  xmin: 103.6824 ymin: 1.248403 xmax: 103.9897 ymax: 1.462134\nz_range:       zmin: 0 zmax: 0\nGeodetic CRS:  WGS 84\nFirst 5 geometries:\n\n\nPOINT Z (103.7614 1.308683 0)\n\n\nPOINT Z (103.7536 1.315748 0)\n\n\nPOINT Z (103.7645 1.305078 0)\n\n\nPOINT Z (103.765 1.305239 0)\n\n\nPOINT Z (103.7597 1.315983 0)\n\n\nThis is a scenario that st_set_crs() is not appropriate and st_transform() of sf package should be used. This is because we need to reproject preschool from one coordinate system to another coordinate system mathemetically.\nLet us perform the projection transformation by using the code chunk below.\n\npreschool3414 <- st_transform(preschool, \n                              crs = 3414)\n\n\nNote: In practice, we need find out the appropriate project coordinate system to use before performing the projection transformation.\n\nNext, let us display the content of preschool3414 sf data frame as shown below.\n\nst_geometry(preschool3414)\n\nGeometry set for 1359 features \nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XYZ\nBounding box:  xmin: 11203.01 ymin: 25667.6 xmax: 45404.24 ymax: 49300.88\nz_range:       zmin: 0 zmax: 0\nProjected CRS: SVY21 / Singapore TM\nFirst 5 geometries:\n\n\nPOINT Z (19997.26 32333.17 0)\n\n\nPOINT Z (19126.75 33114.35 0)\n\n\nPOINT Z (20345.12 31934.56 0)\n\n\nPOINT Z (20400.31 31952.36 0)\n\n\nPOINT Z (19810.78 33140.31 0)\n\n\nNotice that it is in svy21 projected coordinate system now. Furthermore, if you refer to Bounding box:, the values are greater than 0-360 range of decimal degree commonly used by most of the geographic coordinate systems."

    "text": "Importing and Converting An Aspatial Data\nIn practice, it is not unusual that we will come across data such as listing of Inside Airbnb. We call this kind of data aspatial data. This is because it is not a geospatial data but among the data fields, there are two fields that capture the x- and y-coordinates of the data points.\nIn this section, you will learn how to import an aspatial data into R environment and save it as a tibble data frame. Next, you will convert it into a simple feature data frame.\nFor the purpose of this exercise, the listings.csv data downloaded from AirBnb will be used.\n\nImporting the aspatial data\nSince listings data set is in csv file format, we will use read_csv() of readr package to import listing.csv as shown the code chunk below. The output R object is called listings and it is a tibble data frame.\n\nlistings = read_csv(\"data/aspatial/listings.csv\")\n\nRows: 4252 Columns: 16\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr   (5): name, host_name, neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, room_type\ndbl  (10): id, host_id, latitude, longitude, price, minimum_nights, number_o...\ndate  (1): last_review\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nAfter importing the data file into R, it is important for us to examine if the data file has been imported correctly.\nThe code chunk below shows list() of Base R instead of glimpse() is used to do the job.\n\nlist(listings)\n\n[[1]]\n# A tibble: 4,252 × 16\n       id name     host_id host_…¹ neigh…² neigh…³ latit…⁴ longi…⁵ room_…⁶ price\n    <dbl> <chr>      <dbl> <chr>   <chr>   <chr>     <dbl>   <dbl> <chr>   <dbl>\n 1  50646 Pleasan…  227796 Sujatha Centra… Bukit …    1.33    104.

Two useful fields we are going to use in the next phase are latitude and longitude. Note that they are in decimal degree format. As a best guess, we will assume that the data is in wgs84 Geographic Coordinate System.\n\n\nCreating a simple feature data frame from an aspatial data frame\nThe code chunk below converts listing data frame into a simple feature data frame by using st_as_sf() of sf packages\n\nlistings_sf <- st_as_sf(listings, \n                       coords = c(\"longitude\", \"latitude\"),\n                       crs=4326) %>%\n  st_transform(crs = 3414)\n\nThings to learn from the arguments above:\n\ncoords argument requires you to provide the column name of the x-coordinates first then followed by the column name of the y-coordinates.\ncrs argument requires you to provide the coordinates system in epsg format. EPSG: 4326 is wgs84 Geographic Coordinate System and EPSG: 3414 is Singapore SVY21 Projected Coordinate System. You can search for other country's epsg code by referring to epsg.io.\n%>% is used to nest st_transform() to transform the newly created simple feature data frame into svy21 projected coordinates system.\n\nLet us examine the content of this newly created simple feature data frame.\n\nglimpse(listings_sf)\n\nRows: 4,252\nColumns: 15\n$ id                             <dbl> 50646, 71609, 71896, 71903, 275343, 275…\n$ name                           <chr> \"Pleasant Room along Bukit Timah\", \"Ens…\n$ host_id                        <dbl> 227796, 367042, 367042, 367042, 1439258…\n$ host_name                      <chr> \"Sujatha\", \"Belinda\", \"Belinda\", \"Belin…\n$ neighbourhood_group            <chr> \"Central Region\", \"East Region\", \"East …\n$ neighbourhood                  <chr> \"Bukit Timah\", \"Tampines\", \"Tampines\", …\n$ room_type                      <chr> \"Private room\", \"Private room\", \"Privat…\n$ price                          <dbl> 80, 178, 81, 81, 52, 40, 72, 41, 49, 49…\n$ minimum_nights                 <dbl> 90, 90, 90, 90, 14, 14, 90, 8, 14, 14, …\n$ number_of_reviews              <dbl> 18, 20, 24, 48, 20, 13, 133, 105, 14, 1…\n$ last_review                    <date> 2014-07-08, 2019-12-28, 2014-12-10, 20…\n$ reviews_per_month              <dbl> 0.22, 0.28, 0.33, 0.67, 0.20, 0.16, 1.2…\n$ calculated_host_listings_count <dbl> 1, 4, 4, 4, 50, 50, 7, 1, 50, 50, 50, 4…\n$ availability_365               <dbl> 365, 365, 365, 365, 353, 364, 365, 90, …\n$ geometry                       <POINT [m]> POINT (22646.02 35167.9), POINT (…\n\n\nTable above shows the content of listing_sf.
