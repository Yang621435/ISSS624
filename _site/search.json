    "text": "Setting the Scene\nWater is an important resource to mankind. Clean and accessible water is critical to human health. It provides a healthy environment, a sustainable economy, reduces poverty and ensures peace and security. Yet over 40% of the global population does not have access to sufficient clean water. By 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity, according to UN-Water. The lack of water poses a major threat to several sectors, including food security. Agriculture uses about 70% of the world’s accessible freshwater.\nDeveloping countries are most affected by water shortages and poor water quality. Up to 80% of illnesses in the developing world are linked to inadequate water and sanitation. Despite technological advancement, providing clean water to the rural community is still a major development issues in many countries globally, especially countries in the Africa continent.\nTo address the issue of providing clean and sustainable water supply to the rural community, a global Water Point Data Exchange (WPdx) project has been initiated. The main aim of this initiative is to collect water point related data from rural areas at the water point or small water scheme level and share the data via WPdx Data Repository, a cloud-based data library. What is so special of this project is that data are collected based on WPDx Data Standard."

    "text": "Grading Criteria\nThis exercise will be graded by using the following criteria:\n\nGeospatial Data Wrangling (20 marks): This is an important aspect of geospatial analytics. You will be assessed on your ability to employ appropriate R functions from various R packages specifically designed for modern data science such as readr, tidyverse (tidyr, dplyr, ggplot2), sf just to mention a few of them, to perform the entire geospatial data wrangling processes, including. This is not limited to data import, data extraction, data cleaning and data transformation. Besides assessing your ability to use the R functions, this criterion also includes your ability to clean and derive appropriate variables to meet the analysis need. (Warning: All data are like vast grassland full of land mines. Your job is to clear those mines and not to step on them).\nGeospatial Analysis (30 marks): In this exercise, you are expected to use the appropriate thematic and analytics mapping techniques and R functions introduced in class to analysis the geospatial data prepared. You will be assessed on your ability to derive analytical maps by using appropriate rate mapping techniques.\nGeovisualisation (20 marks): In this section, you will be assessed on your ability to communicate the complex spatial statistics results in business friendly visual representations. This course is geospatial centric, hence, it is important for you to demonstrate your competency in using appropriate geovisualisation techniques to reveal and communicate the findings of your analysis.\nReproducibility (20 marks): This is an important learning outcome of this exercise. You will be assessed on your ability to provide a comprehensive documentation of the analysis procedures in the form of code chunks of RMarkdown. It is important to note that it is not enough by merely providing the code chunk without any explanation on the purpose and R function(s) used.\nBonus (10 marks): Demonstrate your ability to employ methods beyond what you had learned in class to gain insights from the data. The methods used must be geospatial in nature."
